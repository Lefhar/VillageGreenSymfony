Files in XML, YAML or JSON also changed in a similar way. Please refer to the official documentation for more details.

Note\+: the {\ttfamily name} property has been removed.

Note\+: the option in {\ttfamily table\+\_\+storage} needs to be updated only if you have changed the metadata table settings by using v2 options such as {\ttfamily table\+\_\+name}, {\ttfamily column\+\_\+name}, {\ttfamily column\+\_\+length} or {\ttfamily executed\+\_\+at\+\_\+column\+\_\+name}. If you did not change those settings, it is recommended to not provide the options and let doctrine figure out the best settings.\hypertarget{md_vendor_doctrine_migrations__u_p_g_r_a_d_e_autotoc_md207}{}\doxysection{Code BC breaks}\label{md_vendor_doctrine_migrations__u_p_g_r_a_d_e_autotoc_md207}
Most of the code is protected by the {\ttfamily @internal} declaration and in a very rare cases you might have dealt with the internals of this library.

The most important BC breaks are in the {\ttfamily Doctrine\textbackslash{}Migrations\textbackslash{}Configuration\textbackslash{}Configuration} class and in the helper system that now has been replaced by the {\ttfamily Doctrine\textbackslash{}Migrations\textbackslash{}Dependency\+Factory} functionalities.

Here is a list of the most important changes\+:

Your migration classes that previously used to extend {\ttfamily Doctrine\textbackslash{}DBAL\textbackslash{}Migrations\textbackslash{}Abstract\+Migration} now need to extend {\ttfamily Doctrine\textbackslash{}Migrations\textbackslash{}Abstract\+Migration} instead. The {\ttfamily Doctrine\textbackslash{}DBAL\textbackslash{}Migrations\textbackslash{}Abstract\+Migration} class will be deprecated in the {\ttfamily 1.\+8.\+0} release to prepare for the BC break.\hypertarget{md_vendor_doctrine_migrations__u_p_g_r_a_d_e_autotoc_md210}{}\doxysubsection{BC Break\+: Removed $<$tt$>$\+Doctrine\textbackslash{}\+DBAL\textbackslash{}\+Migrations\textbackslash{}\+Migrations\+Version$<$/tt$>$}\label{md_vendor_doctrine_migrations__u_p_g_r_a_d_e_autotoc_md210}

To make the name more clear and to differentiate from the {\ttfamily Abstract\+Migration} class, {\ttfamily Migration} was renamed to {\ttfamily Migrator}.\hypertarget{md_vendor_doctrine_migrations__u_p_g_r_a_d_e_autotoc_md212}{}\doxysubsection{BC Break\+: Moved exception classes from $<$tt$>$\+Doctrine\textbackslash{}\+Migrations\textbackslash{}\%name\%\+Exception$<$/tt$>$ to $<$tt$>$\+Doctrine\textbackslash{}\+Migrations\textbackslash{}\+Exception\textbackslash{}\%name\%$<$/tt$>$}\label{md_vendor_doctrine_migrations__u_p_g_r_a_d_e_autotoc_md212}

The method {\ttfamily get\+Name()} was defined and it\textquotesingle{}s implementation would change the order in which the migration would be processed. It would cause discrepancies between the file order in a file browser and the order of execution of the migrations.\hypertarget{md_vendor_doctrine_migrations__u_p_g_r_a_d_e_autotoc_md216}{}\doxysubsubsection{After\+:}\label{md_vendor_doctrine_migrations__u_p_g_r_a_d_e_autotoc_md216}
The {\ttfamily get\+Name()} method as been removed $\vert$ set final and new {\ttfamily get\+Description()} method has been added. The goal of this method is to be able to provide context for the migration. This context is shown for the last migrated migration when the status command is called.\hypertarget{md_vendor_doctrine_migrations__u_p_g_r_a_d_e_autotoc_md217}{}\doxysubsection{–write-\/sql option from the migrate command}\label{md_vendor_doctrine_migrations__u_p_g_r_a_d_e_autotoc_md217}

The {\ttfamily -\/-\/write-\/sql} option would only output sql contained in the migration and would not update the table containing the migrated migrations.\hypertarget{md_vendor_doctrine_migrations__u_p_g_r_a_d_e_autotoc_md219}{}\doxysubsubsection{After\+:}\label{md_vendor_doctrine_migrations__u_p_g_r_a_d_e_autotoc_md219}
That option now also output the sql queries necessary to update the table containing the state of the migrations. If you want to go back to the previous behavior just make a request on the bug tracker as for now the need for it is not very clear.\hypertarget{md_vendor_doctrine_migrations__u_p_g_r_a_d_e_autotoc_md220}{}\doxysubsection{Migrations\+Version\+::\+VERSION}\label{md_vendor_doctrine_migrations__u_p_g_r_a_d_e_autotoc_md220}

It is now a a function so that a different value can be automatically send back if it\textquotesingle{}s a modified version that\textquotesingle{}s used. The returned value is now the git tag. The tag is in lowercase as the other doctrine projects.
