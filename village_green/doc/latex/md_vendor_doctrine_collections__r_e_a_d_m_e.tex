\hypertarget{md_vendor_doctrine_collections__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md135}{}\doxysubsection{v1.\+6.\+1}\label{md_vendor_doctrine_collections__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md135}
This release, combined with the release of \href{https://github.com/doctrine/collections/releases/tag/v1.6.1}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily doctrine/collections} {\ttfamily v1.\+6.\+1}}}, fixes an issue where parsing annotations was not possible for classes within {\ttfamily doctrine/collections}.

Specifically, {\ttfamily v1.\+6.\+0} introduced Psalm-\/specific annotations such as (for example) {\ttfamily @template} and {\ttfamily @template-\/implements}, which were both incorrectly recognized as {\ttfamily @template}.

{\ttfamily @template} has therefore been removed, and instead we use the prefixed {\ttfamily @psalm-\/template}, which is no longer parsed by {\ttfamily doctrine/collections} {\ttfamily v1.\+6.\+1}

This release bumps the minimum required PHP version to 7.\+1.\+3.

Following improvements were introduced\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Array\+Collection\#filter()} now allows filtering by key, value or both.
\item When using the {\ttfamily Closure\+Expression\+Visitor} over objects with a defined accessor and property, the accessor is prioritised.
\item Updated testing tools and coding standards, autoloading, which also led to marginal performance improvements
\item Introduced generic type docblock declarations from \href{https://github.com/vimeo/psalm}{\texttt{ psalm}}, which should allow users to declare {\ttfamily /$\ast$$\ast$ @var Collection\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}Key\+Type, Value\+Type\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} $\ast$/} in their code, and leverage the type propagation deriving from that.
