doctrine/cache will no longer be maintained and all cache implementations have been marked as deprecated. These implementations will be removed in 2.\+0, which will only contain interfaces to provide a lightweight package for backward compatibility.

There are two new classes to use in the {\ttfamily Doctrine\textbackslash{}Common\textbackslash{}Cache\textbackslash{}Psr6} namespace\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The {\ttfamily Cache\+Adapter} class allows using any Doctrine Cache as PSR-\/6 cache. This is useful to provide a forward compatibility layer in libraries that accept Doctrine cache implementations and switch to PSR-\/6.
\item The {\ttfamily Doctrine\+Provider} class allows using any PSR-\/6 cache as Doctrine cache. This implementation is designed for libraries that leak the cache and want to switch to allowing PSR-\/6 implementations. This class is design to be used during the transition phase of sunsetting doctrine/cache support.
