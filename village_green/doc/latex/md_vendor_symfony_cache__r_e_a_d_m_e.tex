The Cache component provides an extended \href{http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-6/}{\texttt{ PSR-\/6}} implementation for adding cache to your applications. It is designed to have a low overhead so that caching is fastest. It ships with a few caching adapters for the most widespread and suited to caching backends. It also provides a {\ttfamily doctrine/cache} proxy adapter to cover more advanced caching needs and a proxy adapter for greater interoperability between PSR-\/6 implementations.\hypertarget{md_vendor_symfony_cache__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1366}{}\doxysection{Resources}\label{md_vendor_symfony_cache__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1366}
